  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    At XIM, students often have to follow multiple Instagram pages just to stay updated with university news, events, or club activities. 
    We realized that this scattered communication made it hard to truly stay connected — so we built 
    <strong>CampVerse</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our mission is simple: to create <strong>one unified space</strong> where every student can easily access updates, share thoughts, 
    and connect meaningfully — whether it’s about academics, events, or just personal vibes. 
    CampVerse brings the whole community together on a single platform that’s made by students, for students.
  </p>

  <h2>What We Offer</h2>
  <p>
    CampVerse allows users to express themselves freely and interact through five unique categories — 
    <strong>General</strong>, <strong>Academics</strong>, <strong>Events</strong>, <strong>ChillHub</strong>, 
    <strong>Confession</strong>, and <strong>Emergency</strong>.
  </p>

  <ul class="features-list">
    <li>🗣 <strong>General:</strong> A space for everyday thoughts, opinions, and open discussions — everything lives here.</li>
    <li>🎓 <strong>Academics:</strong> Share study doubts, collaborate with peers, and exchange academic insights.</li>
    <li>🎉 <strong>Events:</strong> Post about upcoming college events, share reviews, or relive your best campus memories.</li>
    <li>😎 <strong>ChillHub:</strong> Your fun zone — make friends, form casual groups, and share light-hearted moments.</li>
    <li>💌 <strong>Confession:</strong> A safe, anonymous space to express feelings or secrets you’ve never said out loud.</li>
    <li>🚨 <strong>Emergency:</strong> For urgent help or immediate needs — whether personal, academic, or campus-related.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    CampVerse is your one-stop destination — to stay informed, connected, and expressive within your college world.
